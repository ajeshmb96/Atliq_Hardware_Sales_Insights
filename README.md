# ***Sales Data Analysis Project – AtliQ Hardware (India)***

This project aims to analyze and visualize sales data for AtliQ Hardware, a company that supplies computer hardware and peripherals to various clients across India. The project involves cleaning raw data, performing SQL-based analysis, and building a Power BI dashboard to generate actionable business insights for the sales team.

## About the Business
AtliQ Hardware operates pan-India with its headquarters in Delhi and multiple regional offices. It serves clients such as Surge Stores, Nomad Stores, and others. Due to the dynamic nature of the Indian market, the Sales Director struggles to get reliable insights from regional managers who only provide verbal updates, often without evidence or data backing.

This lack of clarity in data reporting makes it difficult to make informed business decisions—especially when the overall sales are declining. The company, therefore, needs a centralized, reliable, and visual tool for daily tracking of key sales metrics.

Enable the Sales Director of AtliQ Hardware to:

- Access real-time, visual sales insights
- Understand performance by region, month, and product
- Identify currency issues, invalid transactions, and growth trends
- Make data-driven decisions to increase overall company performance
